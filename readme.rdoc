= Rubyists.eu

With http://rubyists.eu we aim to make all the Ruby User Groups in Europe visible using Google Maps and a simple Sinatra project. We want to know about all the meetups and events that happen on our continent, because we think we are missing out on way too much fun.

The project is hosted by Heroku.
